## How to Play
- Every level, players are given a certain number of Missiles
- Fire Missiles by clicking on the screen at the location where you want the missile to explode
- When a missile reaches its destination, it creates an expanding Explosions area
- Meteors caught in an Explosion also explode, allowing for "chaining" of Explosions
- Defend your 3 Bases at the bottom of the screen
- Advance to the next level by destroying the number of Meteors indicated on the left-hand side of your screen
- Enjoy!

## Technologies/Languages Used
Meteor Defense is written entirely in vanilla Javascript, using vanilla DOM manipulation to change/update html elements. 
The game-screen utilizes Javascript Canvas to render frame-by-frame object movement, detect object collision, and calculate the speed of the game and its objects.
